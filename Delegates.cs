    //introduce delegates here
    //Delegates are type-safe function pointers that can be used to pass methods as parameters.
    //They are used to define callback methods and event handlers.
    //A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a specific parameter list and return type.
    //Delegates can be used to create custom event handlers, allowing methods to be called in response to specific events.
